            Setting up our Scene Collection
        </h2>

        <p>
            We use a custom OBS Scene Collection for our observers that enable us to show player cams, team logos, and sync our feeds.
        </p>

        <h3>Get a customized OBS Scene Collection</h3>

        <p>
            Visit our <a href="/tools/obs-scene-collections" target="_blank">tools page</a> to download the latest version of our OBS Scene Collection.
            <br>
            Choose a client name (usually your username) and pick the <strong>"Observing"</strong> profile.
            Pick the keybinds you want to use for switching between different players and download the file.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Import it into OBS
        </h3>

        <p>
            Open OBS and go to <strong>Scene Collection > Import</strong>. Select the file you downloaded and press <strong>Import</strong>.
            <br>
            Open the <strong>Scene Collection</strong> dropdown and select the profile you just imported.
        </p>

        <h3>Selecting your Cable</h3>
        <p>
            In the <strong>Observing Scene</strong>, double click on the <strong>Overwatch Audio Cable</strong> source.
            <br>
            Choose the <strong>CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)</strong> you installed earlier.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Testing it out
        </h3>

        <p>
            Launch Overwatch and make sure you can see it fully fill the screen in OBS. There should be no black bars or window borders.
            <br>
            If you see black bars, you may need to adjust the <strong>Overwatch source</strong> settings or change your <strong>Overwatch resolution</strong>.
        </p>

        <b-alert :model-value="true">You should be able to <strong>see Overwatch's audio levels</strong> for the source in the <strong>OBS Audio Mixer</strong>.</b-alert>

        <p>
            At this point you can test out streaming to our server. You can stream to it at any time if you need to test your connection.
        </p>

        <h3>"Zeroing Out"</h3>

        <p>
            Our package will automatically add little shield icons over players' perspectives when you switch to them.
            However, if you switch back to free cam, the shield icons will remain. To remove them, you need to press the <kbd>0</kbd> hotkey.
            You can change this to a different key in the OBS Settings if you want.
