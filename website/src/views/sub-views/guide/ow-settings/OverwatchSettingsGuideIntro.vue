        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Overwatch settings to work with our
            production setup.
        </p>

        <h3><i class="fa fa-file mx-1"></i> File Settings</h3>

        <p>
            These settings are stored in a file on your computer and are kept between accounts. Most of these
            can be set automatically by using our <i class="fa fa-sparkles mx-1"></i> Automatic Settings Tool. <br>
        </p>

        <h3><i class="fa fa-user mx-1"></i> Account Settings</h3>

        <p>
            These settings are stored on the Blizzard servers and are unique to each account. Because of this, it's useful
            to have a separate observer account that you can use to configure these settings. <br>
